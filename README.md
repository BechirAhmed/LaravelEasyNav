# Laravel EasyNav: Easy Navigation Tools for Laravel

Every time I build another Laravel app, I find myself re-using the same custom Navigation helpers I have been perfecting over the years. These tools allow you to accurately and concisely change the class on navigation elements depending on the current page. Tools like these allow you to have your navigation manage itself, speeding up the development progress, but with the efficiency for long term production use.
